- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Haml](https://haml.info/) - For a more readable html
- BEM

### What I learned

This challenge was really fun and I think I'm getting better at writing BEM. I still need to be a bit more carefull when doing any changes and thinking a bit about how that change will afect the site in a diferente resolution, this was my major dificulty, but I think I'm getting better at it, too. I'm taking a bit slow and thinking more instead of just ignoring problem and focusing on something that I would like to do more.
I also learned how to use max-width to make my layout not get distorted.
